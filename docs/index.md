## Some Projects I've Been Tinkering With Lately

**ActionWeaver**: An open source framework for building LLM applications that simplifies function calling with LLMs. [View on GitHub](https://github.com/TengHu/ActionWeaver) 

**AutoCoder**:A weekend side project: a description-to-pull-request bot that answers questions and makes code changes in GitHub repositories using natural language instructions. Built with ActionWeaver and powered by LLM function calling. [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/TengHu/AutoCoder) | [Watch Demo](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tenghu_actionweaver-langsmith-codegeneration-activity-7157437331698802688-PdS0)

**AI Agent for immigration lawyer**
I built a demo for a startup showcasing an end-to-end workflow to automate tasks for immigration lawyers, streamlining the visa application process. [Watch Demo](https://www.loom.com/share/9961027786d8404aa8659e3e71485206)

**An Empirical Study of Neural Network Training Dynamics**: An attempt to uncover what’s really happening during neural network training. [Read the blogpost](./blog/posts/training_dynamics.md)

**When does loss-based prioritization fail?**: A research paper from my time at Uber, exploring methods to robustly accelerate neural network training. [Arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07741)

**Geospatial Monitoring at Scale**: A project while working at Uber - a real-time system that monitors on traffic patterns everywhere Uber operates with Apache Flink and Complex Event Processing. I gave the presentation at Flink Forward San Francisco 2020 on behalf of Uber.
